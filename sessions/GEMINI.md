# Sessions Directory Overview

This `sessions` directory is designated for temporary storage of session-related data, logs, and other ephemeral files generated during development or execution of the project's tools and applications.

## Contents

The contents of this directory are typically:

*   **Temporary Files**: Intermediate results, caches, or scratch data from various processes.
*   **Logs**: Output logs from tool executions, tests, or application runs.
*   **Session-Specific Data**: Data relevant to a particular development or testing session that does not need to be permanently stored or version-controlled.

## Usage

This directory serves as a convenient location for tools to write their transient outputs without cluttering the main project directories. It is often used for:

*   Storing data that is regenerated frequently.
*   Holding large files that are not suitable for version control.
*   Providing a dedicated space for debugging outputs.

## Version Control

The contents of the `sessions` directory are generally ephemeral and are **git-ignored** to prevent them from being committed to the repository. This ensures that the version control system remains clean and focused on the source code and permanent assets of the project.
