# Project Reporter Overview

The `project_reporter` is a Rust crate designed to provide human-readable reports on project analysis data generated by the `hf-dataset-validator` tool.

## Functionality

Currently, the `project_reporter` reads `project_metadata-phase/data.parquet` files from the `analysis_results/` directories of various crates within the `monomcp` workspace. It then extracts and displays key project metadata, such as crate name, version, and description, in a formatted table.

## Key Dependencies

*   **`arrow`**: Provides the Arrow in-memory columnar data format, which is the foundation for the Parquet files.
*   **`parquet`**: Enables reading and processing of Parquet files, where the analysis results are stored.
*   **`anyhow`**: For simplified error handling.
*   **`tokio`**: An asynchronous runtime used for I/O operations, particularly when reading files.

## Future Enhancements

As outlined in the project's Change Requests (CRQs), future enhancements for `project_reporter` include:

*   **Displaying Full Analysis Data**: Extending its capability to read and display data from all analysis phases (e.g., dependency analysis, source code metrics) once those are fully implemented in `hf-dataset-validator`.
*   **Filtering and Sorting**: Adding command-line arguments to allow users to filter and sort the displayed project data.
*   **Exporting Output**: Implementing functionality to export the generated reports to various formats like CSV, JSON, or Markdown.
