**CRQ: Decentralized, AI-Augmented Social Media Content Pipeline for Open-Source Project Promotion**

*   **Description:** Establish a dynamic, collaborative workflow leveraging AI agents and community participation to generate, curate, and disseminate engaging social media content from project updates. This system aims to democratize content creation, amplify project reach, and foster community engagement by allowing users to contribute intermediate assets and participate in content selection.

*   **Core Principles:**
    *   **AI Augmentation:** AI agents (like Gemini) handle repetitive, creative, and analytical tasks.
    *   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Team members and community contributors provide creative direction, quality control, and final approval.
    *   **Decentralized Contribution:** Enable external users to contribute intermediate assets (images, audio, short video clips).
    *   **Gamified Curation:** Implement voting mechanisms for content selection and quality assurance.
    *   **Transparent Workflow:** All stages and decisions are logged and auditable.

*   **Workflow Stages & Agent/Human Roles:**

    1.  **Project Update & Initial Content Generation (Gemini Agent + Core Team)**
        *   **Trigger:** New code commits, significant project milestones, or scheduled content cycles.
        *   **Gemini Task:**
            *   Analyze recent Git history and project documentation.
            *   Draft a concise, engaging "Project Update Poem" (as demonstrated).
            *   Generate initial image concepts from poem lines using an integrated image generation API (e.g., `default_api.generate_image(prompt=poem_line)` - *hypothetical tool*).
            *   Generate initial short video concepts from poem lines/images using an integrated video generation API (e.g., `default_api.generate_video(image_sequence=images, audio_prompt=poem_line)` - *hypothetical tool*).
        *   **Output:** Draft poem, initial image concepts, initial video concepts.

    2.  **Intermediate Asset Contribution (Community + Gemini Agent)**
        *   **Mechanism:** A dedicated web interface or CLI tool where community members can:
            *   Submit alternative image interpretations of poem lines.
            *   Submit short audio clips (e.g., voiceovers of poem lines, sound effects).
            *   Submit short video clips inspired by project themes.
            *   **Gemini Task:**
                *   Receive and categorize submitted assets.
                *   Perform initial quality checks (e.g., resolution, format, basic content filtering).
                *   Generate metadata for each asset (e.g., keywords, style tags).
        *   **Output:** Curated pool of community-contributed images, audio, and video clips.

    3.  **Content Curation & Voting (Core Team + Community + Gemini Agent)**
        *   **Mechanism:** A voting platform (e.g., a web app or a Discord bot integration).
        *   **Gemini Task:**
            *   Present poem lines with multiple AI-generated and community-contributed image/video/audio options.
            *   Track votes from designated team members and community (e.g., "upvote/downvote," "best fit").
            *   Analyze voting patterns and identify top-ranked assets for each poem line/segment.
            *   **Gemini Task (Automated Mixing):** Based on top-voted assets, automatically generate multiple video drafts by mixing selected images, video clips, and audio.
        *   **Output:** Top-voted intermediate assets, multiple video drafts.

    4.  **Final Video Production & Editing (Core Team + Gemini Agent)**
        *   **Human Task:** Core team reviews the top-voted assets and AI-generated video drafts.
        *   **Gemini Task:**
            *   Receive feedback on video drafts (e.g., "make this clip longer," "change music here").
            *   Perform iterative video editing based on human instructions (e.g., `default_api.edit_video(video_id=draft_id, instructions="trim clip 3 by 2 seconds")` - *hypothetical tool*).
            *   Generate platform-specific video formats and aspect ratios.
        *   **Output:** Final polished video assets for each platform.

    5.  **Description Generation & Optimization (Gemini Agent + Core Team)**
        *   **Gemini Task:**
            *   Generate initial social media descriptions for TikTok, X/Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, incorporating relevant keywords, hashtags, and calls to action.
            *   Analyze platform-specific best practices for engagement.
        *   **Human Task:** Core team reviews and refines descriptions.
        *   **Output:** Optimized social media descriptions.

    6.  **Scheduled Dissemination & Performance Monitoring (Gemini Agent + Core Team)**
        *   **Gemini Task:**
            *   Schedule posts across various social media platforms at optimal times.
            *   Monitor post performance (likes, shares, comments, reach, click-throughs).
            *   Generate performance reports and insights.
            *   Suggest optimizations for future content based on performance data.
        *   **Human Task:** Review performance reports, adjust strategy.

*   **Tools & Integrations (Hypothetical & Existing):**
    *   **AI Image Generation:** `default_api.generate_image` (hypothetical)
    *   **AI Video Generation:** `default_api.generate_video` (hypothetical)
    *   **Video Editing API:** `default_api.edit_video` (hypothetical)
    *   **Social Media APIs:** For scheduling and monitoring.
    *   **Version Control:** Git (for tracking content assets and workflow definitions).
    *   **Data Storage:** Parquet files (for intermediate and final data).
    *   **Communication Platform:** Discord/Slack integration for voting and feedback.
    *   **Web Interface/CLI:** For community contributions and team voting.

*   **Success Metrics:**
    *   Increased social media reach and engagement.
    *   Higher quality and diversity of content.
    *   Reduced manual effort in content creation.
    *   Active community participation in content generation and curation.
    *   Measurable impact on project awareness and adoption.
