## Progress Summary: August 28, 2025

**I. Progress Made:**

1.  **`mocopr-server` Compilation Fix:**
    *   Identified and resolved `E0308` (mismatched types) errors in `MoCoPr/mocopr-server/src/server.rs` by correctly converting `String` to `Utf8Bytes` for WebSocket messages.
    *   Successfully built the `mocopr` package (which includes `mocopr-server`) after applying the fix, confirming its resolution.
    *   Committed the fix within the `monomcp/MoCoPr` submodule and pushed it to its `meta-introspector` remote.
    *   Updated the parent `mcp` repository to reference the new `MoCoPr` submodule commit and pushed these changes.

2.  **`simd-kernels` ARM64 Build Issue:**
    *   Identified that `simd-kernels` (due to its `minarrow` dependency) was causing compilation failures on ARM64 (errors `E0554` and `E0308`).
    *   Determined that no newer `minarrow` version was available to resolve these issues.
    *   **Excluded `simd-kernels` from the `monomcp` workspace build** by removing its entry from the `members` section of `monomcp/Cargo.toml`. The `simd-kernels` directory was retained as per user instruction.
    *   Committed and pushed this change to the remote repository.
    *   Created a new Change Request (CRQ) document: `docs/crq/2025-08-28-arm64-simd-kernels-build-issue.md`, detailing the problem, temporary resolution, and next steps for investigation.
    *   Committed and pushed the `simd-kernels` CRQ document.

3.  **New Architectural Goal: Single Static Runtime for Monomcp (BusyBox-like):**
    *   A new overarching architectural goal was defined: to transform `monomcp` into a single, statically linked runtime capable of dynamically discovering and executing functionalities from all its submodules.
    *   A comprehensive CRQ document: `docs/crq/2025-08-28-single-static-runtime-monomcp.md` was created, outlining the goal, motivation, proposed high-level approach (core Rust foundation, dynamic discovery/loading, BusyBox-like interface, dependency management, cross-compilation), initial considerations, verification, impact, and next steps.
    *   Committed and pushed this new CRQ document.

4.  **Vendorization of Key Tools:**
    *   Created the `monomcp/vendor` directory.
    *   Cloned `rust-lang/cargo` into `monomcp/vendor/cargo-platform` to enable modification of `cargo-platform`.
    *   Cloned `meta-introspector/hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust` into `monomcp/vendor/hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust`.
    *   Modified `monomcp/Cargo.toml` to correctly reference these vendorized paths using `[patch.crates-io]` and by adding `hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust` as a workspace member.
    *   Committed and pushed these vendorization changes.

**II. Next Steps:**

1.  **Refine `cargo-platform` Modification for `tree.txt` Generation:**
    *   The immediate next step is to receive specific instructions from the user regarding the desired modifications to the vendorized `cargo-platform` (or any other relevant `cargo` crate). This modification is intended to enable `tree.txt` generation in a specific format or with particular filtering/metadata, which is crucial for the "Dynamic Discovery/Loading" aspect of the "Single Static Runtime" CRQ.

2.  **Dataset Generation and Search:**
    *   Once the `cargo` tool modification is complete, utilize `hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust` (now vendorized) to generate a dataset from the extensive list of code repositories identified earlier (from `~/storage/github/submodules.txt`).
    *   Implement functionality to search this generated dataset.

3.  **Detailed Design and Proof-of-Concept for Single Static Runtime:**
    *   Based on the `tree.txt` analysis (once it can be generated as desired) and the insights gained from `cargo-platform` and `hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust`, begin the detailed architectural design and proof-of-concept implementation for the "Single Static Runtime for Monomcp" as outlined in the new CRQ.
