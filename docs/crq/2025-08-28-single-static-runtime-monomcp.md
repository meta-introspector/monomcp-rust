# Change Request: Single Static Runtime for Monomcp (BusyBox-like)

**Date:** 2025-08-28

**Status:** Proposed

**Goal:**
To transform the `monomcp` project into a single, statically linked runtime, similar to BusyBox. This runtime should be capable of dynamically discovering and executing functionalities provided by all crates within its submodules, starting from a minimal core Rust foundation.

**Problem/Motivation:**
The current `monomcp` project, with its extensive use of submodules and diverse Rust crates, aims to provide a comprehensive software engineering toolkit. However, managing and deploying numerous individual binaries or dynamically linked libraries can be complex and resource-intensive. A single static runtime would offer:
*   **Reduced Footprint:** A smaller overall binary size, especially beneficial for embedded systems or constrained environments.
*   **Simplified Deployment:** A single executable to distribute and manage.
*   **Improved Performance:** Potential for faster startup times and reduced overhead due to static linking.
*   **Enhanced Portability:** Fewer external dependencies, making it easier to run across different environments.

**Proposed Approach (High-Level):**
1.  **Core Rust Foundation:** Identify and establish a minimal, self-contained Rust core that provides essential runtime services.
2.  **Dynamic Discovery/Loading:** Investigate mechanisms for dynamically discovering and loading functionality from other crates within the monorepo. This might involve:
    *   Custom build scripts and procedural macros to embed crate functionalities.
    *   FFI (Foreign Function Interface) for inter-crate communication if necessary.
    *   A centralized registry or manifest within the static runtime to map commands/functions to their respective crate implementations.
3.  **BusyBox-like Interface:** Implement a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to invoke different functionalities (e.g., `monomcp <command> [args]`), where `<command>` corresponds to a function provided by one of the submodules.
4.  **Dependency Management:** Ensure that all necessary dependencies for each submodule's functionality are statically linked into the final `monomcp` binary. This will require careful management of feature flags and dependency trees.
5.  **Cross-Compilation:** Prioritize cross-compilation capabilities to support various target architectures (e.g., ARM64, x86_64).

**Initial Considerations:**
*   **Build System Complexity:** This approach will significantly increase the complexity of the build system.
*   **Rust Features:** Leverage Rust's `no_std`, `alloc`, and procedural macro capabilities.
*   **Existing Tools:** Explore existing Rust projects or libraries that implement similar static linking or dynamic loading patterns.

**Verification:**
Successful compilation of a single `monomcp` binary that can execute a basic command from at least one submodule on a target architecture.

**Impact:**
*   **Transformative:** Fundamentally changes the architecture and deployment model of `monomcp`.
*   **Performance/Efficiency:** Expected significant improvements in binary size, startup time, and resource utilization.

**Next Steps:**
*   Detailed architectural design for dynamic discovery and loading.
*   Proof-of-concept implementation for a single submodule's functionality.
*   Performance benchmarking and comparison with current approach.
