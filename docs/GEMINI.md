# Project Documentation Overview

This `docs` directory serves as the central repository for all project documentation, providing insights into design decisions, operational procedures, and development progress. It is a critical resource for understanding the project's evolution and current state.

## Content Categories

The documentation is organized into several key categories:

*   **Change Requests (CRQs)**: Located directly under `docs/` (e.g., `CRQs_and_Poem.md`, `Social_Media_Content_Pipeline_CRQ.md`) and within the `docs/crq/` subdirectory. These documents outline proposed changes, new features, bug fixes, and architectural shifts, along with their motivations, impacts, and verification steps.
*   **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Found in the `docs/sops/` directory. These documents detail standardized workflows, best practices, and guidelines for various development and operational tasks.
*   **Progress Summaries**: Documents like `progress_summary_2025-08-28.md` provide periodic overviews of development milestones and achievements.
*   **Narratives**: (If present) These documents offer more detailed explanations or stories behind specific features or architectural changes.
*   **CLI Arguments**: (If present) Documentation for command-line interface arguments.
*   **QA Documents**: (If present) Documents related to quality assurance and testing.

## Key Documents
