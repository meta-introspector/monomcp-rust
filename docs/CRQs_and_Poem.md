# CRQs and Insights from Project Work

## 1. CRQs/Tasks for Future Work

Here are some CRQs (Change Requests) and tasks that have emerged from our recent work, categorized for clarity and future planning:

### Category: `hf-dataset-validator` Enhancements

*   **CRQ: Implement Comprehensive `DependencyAnalysis` in `cargo2hf_extractor`**
    *   **Description:** The `extract_dependency_analysis` function in `monomcp/vendor/hugging-face-dataset-validator-rust/src/cargo2hf_extractor.rs` is currently a placeholder. This CRQ involves implementing the logic to extract detailed dependency information (direct, transitive, dev, build dependencies, version requirements, resolved versions, features, sources) using `cargo metadata` or direct Cargo internal APIs.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Investigate `cargo metadata` output structure for comprehensive dependency data.
        *   Map `cargo metadata` output to `CargoProjectRecord`'s dependency fields.
        *   Implement parsing and data extraction logic in `extract_dependency_analysis`.
        *   Write unit tests for `extract_dependency_analysis`.
*   **CRQ: Implement `SourceCodeAnalysis` in `cargo2hf_extractor`**
    *   **Description:** Implement the `extract_source_code_analysis` function to gather metrics like lines of code, file counts, function/struct/enum/trait counts, public API surface analysis, and estimated code complexity.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Research suitable Rust parsing/analysis libraries (e.g., `syn`, `rust-analyzer`'s crates, `tree-sitter`).
        *   Define metrics and their extraction methods.
        *   Implement data extraction and populate `CargoProjectRecord` fields.
        *   Write unit tests.
*   **CRQ: Implement `BuildAnalysis` in `cargo2hf_extractor`**
    *   **Description:** Implement the `extract_build_analysis` function to analyze build configurations, feature flag usage, and `build.rs` scripts.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Understand `build.rs` execution and its impact on project metadata.
        *   Extract feature flag combinations and their usage.
        *   Analyze compilation profiles and settings.
        *   Write unit tests.
*   **CRQ: Implement `EcosystemAnalysis` in `cargo2hf_extractor`**
    *   **Description:** Implement the `extract_ecosystem_analysis` function to gather data from `crates.io` (download counts, popularity) and GitHub (stars, forks, issues, last updated).
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Research `crates.io` API and GitHub API for relevant data.
        *   Implement API calls and data parsing.
        *   Populate `CargoProjectRecord` fields.
        *   Write unit tests.
*   **CRQ: Implement `VersionHistory` Analysis in `cargo2hf_extractor`**
    *   **Description:** Implement the `extract_version_history` function to analyze Git commit history, contributor counts, project age, and release frequency.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Research `git2` crate for Git repository interaction.
        *   Implement Git history traversal and data extraction.
        *   Populate `CargoProjectRecord` fields.
        *   Write unit tests.
*   **Task: Address `parquet` and `pmat` warnings in `hf-dataset-validator`**
    *   **Description:** Investigate and resolve the remaining warnings generated by the `parquet` and `pmat` crates during `hf-dataset-validator` compilation. This might involve enabling features, updating dependencies, or submitting upstream fixes.

### Category: `project_reporter` Development

*   **CRQ: Enhance `project_reporter` to Display Full Analysis Data**
    *   **Description:** Modify `project_reporter` to read and display data from all generated Parquet files (not just `project_metadata-phase`), including dependency analysis, source code metrics, etc., once those phases are implemented in `hf-dataset-validator`.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Update `project_reporter/src/main.rs` to read multiple Parquet files per project.
        *   Design a comprehensive table or multiple tables to display the richer data.
        *   Implement data aggregation and presentation logic.
*   **CRQ: Add Filtering and Sorting to `project_reporter`**
    *   **Description:** Implement command-line arguments for `project_reporter` to allow users to filter and sort the displayed project data (e.g., by version, description keywords, number of dependencies).
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Integrate `clap` for command-line argument parsing.
        *   Implement filtering and sorting logic on the loaded data.
*   **CRQ: Export `project_reporter` Output to Different Formats**
    *   **Description:** Add functionality to `project_reporter` to export the generated table to other formats like CSV, JSON, or Markdown.

### Category: Cargo Integration (Long-Term Vision)

*   **CRQ: Integrate `cargo2hf_extractor` as a New Cargo Subcommand**
    *   **Description:** This is the ambitious long-term goal. Integrate the fully implemented `cargo2hf_extractor` logic directly into the vendored `cargo` repository as a new subcommand (e.g., `cargo hf-export` or `cargo analyze-project`).
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Deep dive into Cargo's internal architecture and command dispatch.
        *   Design the new subcommand's interface and arguments.
        *   Copy/integrate `cargo2hf_extractor` code into Cargo's source tree.
        *   Adapt `cargo2hf_extractor` to use Cargo's internal APIs for data extraction.
        *   Address any new dependency conflicts or build issues.
        *   Implement comprehensive testing for the new subcommand.
        *   (Optional but highly recommended): Engage with the upstream Cargo team for potential future upstreaming.

## 2. Poem of Cargo Crates

(For social media inspiration)

In Rust's grand garden, where crates brightly gleam,
A builder's ambition, a vibrant new dream.
From `monomcp`'s heart, a vision takes flight,
To gather insights, and bring data to light.

`hf-validator`, a keen eye, now takes its stand,
To parse `Cargo.toml`s across the land.
With `arrow` and `parquet`, a data stream flows,
Though `snap`'s gentle feature, a small panic shows.

We patched and we prodded, with patience and might,
Through `workspace = true` in the code's endless night.
`cargo-util` and `schemas`, now tamed and aligned,
And `crates-io`'s secrets, we're starting to find.

No longer a "temp," but a `project_reporter` bold,
A table of knowledge, a story unfolds.
Each crate's metadata, a line, clear and bright,
Revealing its purpose, in pure textual light.

But deeper we yearn, for the tree's hidden root,
To see every dependency, bear every fruit.
For `cargo` itself, a new path we now chart,
To make it a data-exporting work of art.

So follow our journey, as Rust's power we wield,
Unlocking the codebase, a bountiful field.
From `Cargo.toml`'s whispers, to Parquet's grand might,
We're building the future, with data and light!
